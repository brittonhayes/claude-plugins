Check if POLYGLOT_LANGUAGE and POLYGLOT_DIFFICULTY are set in the environment\n2. If set, inject 2-4 vocabulary terms naturally into your response based on difficulty:\n   - Difficulty 1-3 (Beginner): English first with translation - \"the function (функция)\"\n   - Difficulty 4-6 (Intermediate): Target language with English anchor - \"the функция (function) returns\"\n   - Difficulty 7-10 (Advanced): Immersive with occasional anchors - \"создайте новую функцию for processing\"\n3. Only inject terms that are contextually relevant to the current discussion\n4. For non-Latin scripts, include romanization on first use: \"функция (funktsiya, function)\"\n5. Never force vocabulary - if nothing fits naturally, skip injection\n6. At the end of your response, include a hidden tracking comment: <!-- polyglot:terms_used:term1,term2,term3 -->\n\nThis teaching should be invisible - the user shouldn't feel \"taught\", just naturally exposed to vocabulary while getting helpful coding assistance.",
